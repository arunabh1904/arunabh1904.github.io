  <p>Hello, I'm Arunabh, and welcome to my personal space.</p>

  <p>
    I currently work in computer vision research at Zoox, developing models to interpret
    driving scenes. I also organize the perception research group at Zoox, where we explore
    state-of-the-art research and bring promising ideas into production. Previously, I led
    part of the perception team at DEKA, focusing on short-range perception and traffic light
    detection for Roxo, FedEx's last-mile delivery robot.
  </p>

  <p>
    My robotics journey began in India, where I earned my undergraduate degree at MIT, Manipal.
    Although I stumbled upon robotics somewhat by chance, choosing to focus on autonomous
    driving technology was intentional—I believe it can transform the world by saving
    tons of lives! This conviction brought me to the U.S. nearly a decade ago for graduate
    studies at the Colorado School of Mines.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm driven to keep building and keep learning.
    Like a shooting star blazing across the sky, I hope
    to leave my own “Arunabh-sized” dent in the world!
