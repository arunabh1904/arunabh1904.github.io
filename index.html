  <p class="lead">Hello, I'm Arunabh, and welcome to my personal space.</p>

  <p class="intro-text">
    I currently work in computer vision research at Zoox developing models to interpret
    driving scenes. I also organize the perception research group at Zoox, where we explore
    state-of-the-art research and bring promising ideas into production. Previously, I led
    part of the perception team at DEKA, focusing on short-range perception and traffic light
    detection for Roxo, FedEx's last-mile delivery robot.
  </p>

  <p class="intro-text">
    My robotics journey began in India, where I earned my undergraduate degree at MIT, Manipal.
    Although I stumbled upon robotics somewhat by chance, choosing to focus on autonomous
    driving technology was intentional&mdash;I believe it can transform the world by saving
    tons of lives! This conviction brought me to the U.S. nearly a decade ago for graduate
    studies at the Colorado School of Mines.
  </p>

  <p class="intro-text">
    I'm driven to keep building and keep learning. Like a shooting star blazing across the sky,
    I hope to leave my own ‚ÄúArunabh-sized‚Äù dent in the world!
