  <p>Hello, I'm Arunabh and welcome to my personal space.</p>

  <p>I’m currently immersed in computer vision research at Zoox, where I focus on developing a wide range of models that represent driving scenes. Additionally, I lead the perception research group, where we explore state-of-the-art literature to identify and implement cutting-edge initiatives in production. Before this, I was a tech lead on the perception team at DEKA, where my team was responsible for the short-range perception and traffic light detection stacks for Roxo, the FedEx last-mile delivery robot.</p>

  <p>My journey in robotics began in India, where I earned my undergraduate degree at MIT, Manipal. Discovering robotics was a serendipitous event, but choosing to focus on autonomous driving technology was intentional. I became deeply convinced of its life-saving potential, which led me to the U.S. nearly a decade ago to pursue graduate studies at the Colorado School of Mines.</p>

  <p>I’m on a mission to keep building, keep learning, and eventually leave an Arunabh-sized dent in the world — just like that shooting star that blazes its trail across the sky!!</p>
