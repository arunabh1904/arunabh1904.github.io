## Introduction

In 2023, I gave [this interview](https://theinterviewportal.com/2024/01/21/perception-roboticist-interview/) where I primarily discussed how I landed my role as a robotics engineer focused on perception. But looking back, I realized that interview mostly highlighted the wins - and didn’t touch much on the many missteps and setbacks along the way. To give a more balanced view, I want to share some additional reflections on my journey so far, starting from the very beginning.

## Growing Up

I grew up in Jaipur, a city that shaped much of my early life. I lost my father when I was 5, but my mother and sisters made sure I never felt that I was missing anything while growing up, surrounding me with immense love and support. Despite their efforts, I remained quite introverted, finding an escape in video games like DOTA and DOTA 2. In fact, I logged around **16,000** hours and even reached the **#16 rank in India** at one point. It was an obsession that helped me cope with life’s stresses, but over time, I realized that channeling similar dedication into the “real” world could lead to more significant accomplishments. That revelation eventually pulled me out of my shell and motivated me to pursue my dreams in the US.

My schooling was mostly in Jaipur, and like many aspiring engineers, I spent three intense years in Kota preparing for the JEE. Often dubbed a **factory** ([Netflix show](https://www.netflix.com/title/81249783) / [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kota_Factory)), Kota thrives on fierce academic competition. It’s also a breeding ground for [Girard's mimetic theory of desire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimetic_theory), where students emulate each other’s ambitions and anxieties. Despite my hard work, I ended up among the thousands who didn’t clear the IIT exam. At 18, the disappointment felt crushing - like I’d let everyone down after years of preparation. Even now, at 33, the memory of that failure still sends shudders down my spine.

### Takeaways
- **Be resilient** in the face of adversity.
- Sometimes, **no matter how hard you try, you will fail** - and that's okay.
- **It's okay to indulge** in things you like (like video games), but don’t let them consume you.
