# First Job at DEKA

After grad school, I joined DEKA as one of the initial engineers on a project developing autonomous robots for FedExâ€™s last-mile delivery. While DEKA is primarily recognized for its medical devices, its venture into robotics projects provided me with a unique opportunity. Here, I transitioned from planning to specializing in robot perception using machine learning. The small, agile team at DEKA was the perfect setting for broadening my skill set, allowing me to make substantial contributions to the perception stack. I developed expertise in ML tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and TensorRT, along with GPU programming languages like CUDA and OpenCL, which paved the way to my dream job.

Looking back, my journey at DEKA was more than just a job; it was a crucial stepping stone that enriched my professional experience. The diversity of tasks and challenges I faced there played a key role in shaping my skills and preparing me for the future. I also made some great friends that I am in touch with to this day.
