# First Job at DEKA

Right after grad school, I landed at DEKA, joining a small, tight-knit team of engineers working on autonomous robots designed for FedEx’s last-mile deliveries. DEKA was mostly known for medical devices, so this robotics project felt like stepping into exciting new territory. Initially, I started out in planning but soon found my passion in robot perception and machine learning. It was here, within our agile, collaborative team, that I truly expanded my skills, diving deep into ML frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and TensorRT, as well as GPU programming using CUDA and OpenCL.

My graduate research had been entirely focused on optimal controls, so when my first task at DEKA was to train a neural network, I had no idea where to start. I vividly remember that uncomfortable feeling as I put my headphones on and just began typing - determined to figure it out. Reflecting on it now, that initial discomfort turned out to be a powerful motivator. It was the first step on a path that ultimately led to my first patent. I immersed myself in reading, learned how to effectively collect data, and built custom mechanisms to do so. I still recall carefully mounting cameras with precise extrinsics onto our makeshift data collection bot, essentially a modified wheelchair. Countless hours were spent driving around, meticulously adjusting angles, and ensuring we captured every necessary perspective. Then came the painstaking task of personally labeling massive datasets, driven by the determination to prove to myself - and my manager - that the concept would work. Finally, I figured out how to properly train a network, crafted insightful visualizations, and deployed the model in real-time on a Jetson Xavier.

In hindsight, much of this work may seem trivial to someone who graduates with an ML degree today, but as someone learning everything from scratch on the job, each small success felt monumental. This experience taught me something profound: embracing uncertainty is often the best way to grow. And, file a ton of [patents](https://patents.justia.com/inventor/arunabh-mishra).

This experience turned out to be the key that opened the door to my dream job.

Looking back, my time at DEKA was more than just a stepping stone in my career - it was genuinely transformative. The challenges and variety of projects didn’t just teach me technical skills; they shaped the way I approach problems and collaborate with others. Plus, I made some wonderful friends there, people I still stay in touch with today.
