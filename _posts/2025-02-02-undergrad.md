# Undergrad at MIT, Manipal

I stayed back an extra year, prepped hard, and eventually got accepted to MIT, Manipal. Although not an IIT, it has a fairly decent engineering school. I started out as a pretty average student in college. I continued to stay in my introverted shell and played even more DOTA, averaging about 6-8 hours a day. I also picked up smoking cigarettes, which is the worst habit I've ever had in my life. I skipped a lot of classes during my first and second years, and at one point, my cumulative GPA was a shocking 0.74 - not out of 4, but out of 10! When I saw 0.74 written on my report card where the GPA was supposed to be, something inside me broke, but in a good way. It was a wake-up call. I started attending classes, made a few new friends, and began working really hard. I didn’t miss any classes, stayed over the summer, and put in a tremendous amount of effort. By the end of the third year, I had already raised my GPA to 7.8 from a measly 0.74. I kept pushing and finally ended up getting the highest marks in the toughest subject in the course, earning a recommendation for my grad school applications from the head of the department!

My undergrad degree was in Mechatronics Engineering. The theoretical subjects were okay, but what really excited me were the projects. That’s where I got my first taste of robotics. In my final year, a couple of friends and I built an areca-nut harvesting robot for our thesis. Areca nut trees are these 30-foot-tall trees that many harvesters in India have to climb to collect the nuts. Climbing them is a dangerous job that leads to numerous accidents and fatalities every year. To make harvesting safer, we built a rough prototype capable of climbing these tall trees and harvesting the nuts. The robot was remotely controlled using a PlayStation controller and designed to climb and harvest using a cutter.

In a bit of a comical twist, we accidentally broke the robot just before filming our final video. So, in a moment of resourcefulness, we filmed it descending the tree, then reversed the footage in editing, and submitted it as our final presentation. We ended up getting an A!

Nevertheless, it was a really cool concept, and a similar design is now in production, saving lives and helping farmers harvest much more safely. This is what robotics is all about - making people's lives safer and more efficient.

### Takeaways
- **It's never too late to start.**
- **Jugaad** (resourcefulness in Hindi) is okay, as long as you don’t cheat outright!
- **Building things that help others** brings a ton of joy.
