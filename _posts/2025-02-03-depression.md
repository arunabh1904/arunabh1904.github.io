# Depression

I believe it's almost more important to acknowledge the lows in life as we cherish the highs. If you introspect on the lows, you'll undoubtedly come away with many more lessons that will help you move forward. After college, I suffered through a bout of depression. It wasn't easy. While depression is becoming increasingly well-understood in India today, it wasn't widely recognized a decade ago. More than once, when I told someone I didn't feel like getting up or coming out of my room, they would say, "Just take a cold shower; you'll be fine." How I wish I could have shared my internal turmoil with them - told them my brain was on fire, I felt like screaming from the inside, and I couldn't find a way out. I want to share this experience in the hope that it might resonate with someone reading this and provide some solace that they are not the only ones feeling this way.

So, here goes...

After graduation, I had my heart set on pursuing a master's degree in Germany. The education was free, and many of my friends were heading there - naturally, it seemed like the best reason to go. I returned to Jaipur for what was supposed to be a brief stay, with one goal: apply to colleges in Germany and leave within six months. I took the GRE, prepared my applications, and applied to a few universities, including an ultra-safe option to ensure I'd get in. When the day came, I mailed all five applications together, confident about my future.

A month later, I was anxiously waiting for the results. Then, I received an email from my safe school. I opened it, expecting good news, only to read that I was being rejected for missing documents. To my horror, I realized I had accidentally sent the documents meant for the safe school to another university. Slowly, the rejection emails from all five universities trickled in, and the reality set in - I wasn't going to Germany.

I was devastated, and it plunged me into a deep depression. For about nine months, my life became a bleak cycle: I'd get up, barely eat, play DOTA 2 in a dark room for 12 hours, smoke heavily, and then go back to sleep, only to repeat the same routine the next day. It was a dark time.

But in the middle of 2015, a couple of pivotal events occurred. First, a group of close friends dragged me into an impromptu trip. It turned out to be the best thing that could have happened. I spent a few weeks away from my dark room, and slowly, my spirits lifted. Traveling, especially with close friends, felt like therapy.

Second, I lost someone dear to me in a completely avoidable car accident. This tragic event hit me hard and became a turning point in my life. It made me realize the fragility of life and the importance of pursuing what truly matters.

These experiences were crucial in helping me find my purpose and clarify what I genuinely wanted to focus on. Discovering robotics was serendipitous, but choosing to specialize in autonomous driving technology was intentional. That year was transformative. I decided to apply again, but this time for graduate programs in the United States. To strengthen my application, I gained valuable experience working at a friend's startup, engaged in volunteer work, and began taking online programming courses. Classes like Andrew Ng's Deep Learning, CS50 by David Malan, and a MATLAB course proved to be incredibly helpful primers.

The results started rolling in, and I was accepted into three different schools. I still remember rereading the first acceptance email about five times, in disbelief that I had actually been accepted! With newfound clarity and excitement, I packed my bags and headed to the U.S. for grad school, ready to start a new chapter as a robotics graduate student at the Colorado School of Mines!
