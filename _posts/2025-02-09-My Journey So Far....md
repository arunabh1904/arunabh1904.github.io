# My Journey So Far...

## Introduction
I gave this interview back in 2023, where I sat down with Shyam from the Interview Portal and answered some questions about how I landed my role as a robotics engineer focused on perception. However, reflecting on that interview, I realize it's overly focused on the wins. In reality, there were many losses that led to those wins. Here are some additional details that provide a fuller picture of my journey so far...

## GROWING UP
I grew up in Jaipur, a city that shaped much of my early life. I lost my father when I was 5, but my mother and sisters never let me feel that I was missing anything growing up. They showed me immense love and support, helping me navigate those challenging early years.

I was a very introverted child, often retreating into my own world. Video games, especially DOTA and DOTA 2, became my escape. I spent countless hours—about **16,000**!—immersed in these games, even ranking **#16 in India** at one point. Over time, I realized that if I channeled the same energy and dedication into other areas of life, I could achieve much more in the ‘real’ world. This insight gradually pulled me out of my shell and brought me to the US.

My education was primarily in Jaipur, but I also spent three years in Kota preparing for the JEE. Kota is often referred to as a **factory** ([Netflix show](https://www.netflix.com/title/81249783) / [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kota_Factory)) because of its intense academic competition. It’s a place where [Girard's mimetic theory of desire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimetic_theory) plays out vividly. Students imitate each other’s drive for success (as well as stress and anxiety), all trying to outdo one another. This environment can be overwhelming—especially for teenagers who aren’t emotionally equipped to handle that level of pressure. I was among the thousands of kids who couldn’t crack the IIT exam. At the time, it felt like the end of the world. The disappointment of letting down my family after years of intense preparation still sends shudders down my spine at 33. You can imagine the toll it took on my 18-year-old self.

### Takeaways
- **Be resilient** in the face of adversity.  
- Sometimes, **no matter how hard you try, you will fail**—and that's okay.  
- **It's okay to indulge** in things you like (e.g., video games), but don’t let them consume you.

## UNDERGRAD IN MANIPAL
I stayed back an extra year, prepped hard, and eventually got accepted to MIT, Manipal. Although not an IIT, it has a fairly decent engineering school. I started out as a pretty average student in college. I continued to stay in my introverted shell and played even more DOTA, averaging about 6-8 hours a day. I also picked up smoking cigarettes, which is the worst habit I've ever had in my life. I skipped a lot of classes during my first and second years, and at one point, my cumulative GPA was a shocking 0.74—not out of 4, but out of 10! When I saw 0.74 written on my report card where the GPA was supposed to be, something inside me broke, but in a good way. It was a wake-up call. I started attending classes, made a few new friends, and began working really hard. I didn’t miss any classes, stayed over the summer, and put in a tremendous amount of effort. By the end of the third year, I had already raised my GPA to 7.8 from a measly 0.74. I kept pushing and finally ended up getting the highest marks in the toughest subject in the course, earning a recommendation for my grad school applications from the head of the department!

My undergrad degree was in Mechatronics Engineering. The theoretical subjects were okay, but what really excited me were the projects. That’s where I got my first taste of robotics. In my final year, a couple of friends and I built an areca-nut harvesting robot for our thesis. Areca nut trees are these 30-foot-tall trees that many harvesters in India have to climb to collect the nuts. Climbing them is a dangerous job that leads to numerous accidents and fatalities every year. To make harvesting safer, we built a rough prototype capable of climbing these tall trees and harvesting the nuts. The robot was remotely controlled using a PlayStation controller and designed to climb and harvest using a cutter.

In a bit of a comical twist, we accidentally broke the robot just before filming our final video. So, in a moment of resourcefulness, we filmed it descending the tree, then reversed the footage in editing, and submitted it as our final presentation. We ended up getting an A!

Nevertheless, it was a really cool concept, and a similar design is now in production, saving lives and helping farmers harvest much more safely. This is what robotics is all about—making people's lives safer and more efficient.

### Takeaways
- **It's never too late to start.**
- **Jugaad** (resourcefulness in Hindi) is okay, as long as you don’t cheat outright!
- **Building things that help others** brings a ton of joy.

## DEPRESSION
I believe it's almost more important to acknowledge the lows in life as we cherish the highs. If you introspect on the lows, you'll undoubtedly come away with many more lessons that will help you move forward. After college, I suffered through a bout of depression. It wasn't easy. While depression is becoming increasingly well-understood in India today, it wasn't widely recognized a decade ago. More than once, when I told someone I didn't feel like getting up or coming out of my room, they would say, "Just take a cold shower; you'll be fine." How I wish I could have shared my internal turmoil with them—told them my brain was on fire, I felt like screaming from the inside, and I couldn't find a way out. I want to share this experience in the hope that it might resonate with someone reading this and provide some solace that they are not the only ones feeling this way.

So, here goes...

After graduation, I had my heart set on pursuing a master's degree in Germany. The education was free, and many of my friends were heading there—naturally, it seemed like the best reason to go. I returned to Jaipur for what was supposed to be a brief stay, with one goal: apply to colleges in Germany and leave within six months. I took the GRE, prepared my applications, and applied to a few universities, including an ultra-safe option to ensure I'd get in. When the day came, I mailed all five applications together, confident about my future.

A month later, I was anxiously waiting for the results. Then, I received an email from my safe school. I opened it, expecting good news, only to read that I was being rejected for missing documents. To my horror, I realized I had accidentally sent the documents meant for the safe school to another university. Slowly, the rejection emails from all five universities trickled in, and the reality set in—I wasn't going to Germany.

I was devastated, and it plunged me into a deep depression. For about nine months, my life became a bleak cycle: I'd get up, barely eat, play DOTA 2 in a dark room for 12 hours, smoke heavily, and then go back to sleep, only to repeat the same routine the next day. It was a dark time.

But in the middle of 2015, a couple of pivotal events occurred. First, a group of close friends dragged me into an impromptu trip. It turned out to be the best thing that could have happened. I spent a few weeks away from my dark room, and slowly, my spirits lifted. Traveling, especially with close friends, felt like therapy.

Second, I lost someone dear to me in a completely avoidable car accident. This tragic event hit me hard and became a turning point in my life. It made me realize the fragility of life and the importance of pursuing what truly matters.

These experiences were crucial in helping me find my purpose and clarify what I genuinely wanted to focus on. Discovering robotics was serendipitous, but choosing to specialize in autonomous driving technology was intentional. That year was transformative. I decided to apply again, but this time for graduate programs in the United States. To strengthen my application, I gained valuable experience working at a friend's startup, engaged in volunteer work, and began taking online programming courses. Classes like Andrew Ng's Deep Learning, CS50 by David Malan, and a MATLAB course proved to be incredibly helpful primers.

The results started rolling in, and I was accepted into three different schools. I still remember rereading the first acceptance email about five times, in disbelief that I had actually been accepted! With newfound clarity and excitement, I packed my bags and headed to the U.S. for grad school, ready to start a new chapter as a robotics graduate student at the Colorado School of Mines!

### Takeaways
- **Depression can be scary.**
- **Having a purpose** makes it low-effort to work hard.
- **Always have a backup plan.**

## GRAD SCHOOL AT MINES
In 2016, I moved to the United States to pursue a Master’s degree in Robotics at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM). CSM is a relatively small STEM school, but it had a challenging program that required significant effort to succeed. I remember feeling out of place during my first few months. Everything was new and unfamiliar—the culture, the academic environment, and even the way classes were taught. As an introvert, this adjustment period was particularly tough. Over time, however, I found my rhythm and began to genuinely enjoy learning.

Before the start of the semester, I looked for on-campus opportunities to become self-reliant as soon as possible. I was persistent in checking the listing board and eventually landed a teaching assistant position. As a TA, I assisted the professor in grading and administrative tasks. It wasn't the most educational role, but it served its purpose. I was also intentional about my goals for the grad program. I knew I wanted to explore robotics and learn how to code, so I tailored my coursework accordingly. I worked hard in my first semester and took a challenging robotics course with Dr. Andrew Petruska, a new professor who was instrumental in building the robotics program at Mines. By excelling in his course, I secured a research assistant position in his lab.

In my second semester, I joined Dr. Petruska's lab as a research assistant. Initially, I worked on a project involving magnetic manipulation, but I quickly realized it wasn't something I was passionate about, and my lack of progress reflected that. In my free time, I spent countless hours tinkering with the Husky robot in the lab, even writing my own ROS packages to make it move. Dr. Petruska noticed my interest and transitioned me to that project. That change made all the difference. The lab became my second home, and I spent more time there than at my apartment. I focused on learning the basics and building a solid foundation in C++ programming and ROS. Curiosity was key. One funny story I remember is when we short-circuited the entire onboard compute stack and spent a couple of weeks putting it back together from scratch. It was a lot of fun and a great learning experience.

The third semester at CSM was a turning point in my career. I spent a lot of time conducting independent research, programming the Husky robot for autonomous navigation in GPS-denied environments using optimal control strategies. My research collaborators and I spent countless hours covering the whiteboards in the lab with equations, then implementing them in code late into the night. I also took several robotics courses to supplement my research through projects. I got my first taste of machine learning, hand-coding backpropagation from scratch. I still remember the thrill when the loss decreased for the first time—it was exhilarating. I also built a hexapod robot and implemented SLAM using a 1D LiDAR and a basic Pixy camera. All of this gave me a solid understanding of the components needed for an autonomous robot: building a map, localizing based on that map, perceiving the environment in real time, and planning to reach the goal without collisions. Eventually, we deployed the robot inside CSM's Edgar Mine, achieving GPS-denied autonomous navigation using the MPC we developed. It was freezing inside the mine, but it was incredibly rewarding to see the robot navigate without running into things.

Looking back, what worked for me was focusing on building a strong foundation in the skills I was passionate about and actively seeking out opportunities to apply those skills in practical situations. Grad school isn’t just about getting good grades—it’s about the projects you take on, the challenges you solve, and the connections you make. For students in grad school now, my advice is to take on projects that challenge you, use the resources around you (labs, professors, peers), and focus on what really excites you. That’s how you’ll make progress and open doors in the industry.

### Takeaways
- **Focus on building a strong foundation** in the areas that excite you.
- **It's okay to feel out of place** in the beginning. Navigating many changes at once can be overwhelming, but it's part of the process.
- **Be intentional** about what you want to get out of grad school. Tailor your coursework and experiences to align with your interests.
- **Seek out hands-on opportunities**, like TA and RA positions, to apply your learning in practical settings.

## FINDING A JOB OUT OF GRAD SCHOOL
Honestly, landing your first job out of grad school in the U.S. can be challenging, especially if you're trying to find your dream job right away and you’re not from a top university. Even if you've spent your grad school years upskilling, working on relevant projects, and conducting research, it can still be tough. Here are some of the things that worked for me:

**Interviewing** is a slightly different beast than actually doing the job. There is a certain progression to it, and you have to prepare for every level.

- **Resume Preparation**: The first step is your resume. Aim for a simple one-pager. Make sure to highlight key projects tailored to the specific role you’re applying for.

- **Code Screen**: Spend time learning the fundamentals of the primary language required for the role (C++ and Python for robotics). Brush up on data structures and algorithms with a curated list like Blind 75.

- **Onsite Interview**: Multiple rounds, including algorithms, behavioral questions, and domain knowledge. Be able to expand on anything on your resume and dive deep if asked.

- **Apply Broadly**: Quantity often beats quality for fresh grads. Keep a spreadsheet with details of your applications.

- **Start Early**: Begin before your final semester, look for research projects or internships.

- **Get Experience First**: Don’t be overly selective about your first role; initial experience can make it easier to pivot later.

- **Career Fairs**: These can be helpful, but don’t rely on them exclusively.

- **Honesty**: Never lie on your resume.

## FIRST JOB - DEKA
After grad school, I joined DEKA as one of the initial engineers on a project developing autonomous robots for FedEx’s last-mile delivery. While DEKA is primarily recognized for its medical devices, its venture into robotics projects provided me with a unique opportunity. Here, I transitioned from planning to specializing in robot perception using machine learning. The small, agile team at DEKA was the perfect setting for broadening my skill set, allowing me to make substantial contributions to the perception stack. I developed expertise in ML tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and TensorRT, along with GPU programming languages like CUDA and OpenCL, which paved the way to my dream job.

Looking back, my journey at DEKA was more than just a job; it was a crucial stepping stone that enriched my professional experience. The diversity of tasks and challenges I faced there played a key role in shaping my skills and preparing me for the future. I also made some great friends that I am in touch with to this day.

## ZOOX - HIGH IMPACT
Moving to Zoox, a leader in autonomous driving technology, was the realization of a long-held dream. At Zoox, I am fully immersed in computer vision research, continuously applying and expanding upon the knowledge and skills I’ve gathered throughout my academic and professional journey. I’m part of the Perception team at Zoox. Our team acts as the eyes of the robot, focusing on processing data from sensors like cameras and LIDARs to create representations that the robot uses for planning and action in the real world. These representations are typically machine-learned to generalize across different domains. My specific role involves building representations for scene semantics and agent intents, requiring a solid foundation in ML and software engineering. This includes proficiency in languages like C++, Python, and CUDA, as well as a deep understanding of the latest in computer vision research. I have picked up these skills along my journey through self-teaching, my time in grad school, and my time at DEKA.

Another experience that remains vivid in my memory is when I joined Zoox. Feeling out of place among my incredibly talented colleagues, I encountered a typical instance of imposter syndrome. To combat this, I focused on persevering and working even harder, aiming for and achieving small wins. These victories gradually built up my confidence, eventually providing me with the assurance needed to overcome the imposter syndrome. This issue is super common when you switch roles, and it’s important to recognize it as part of the professional growth process, not as a sign of incompetence.
