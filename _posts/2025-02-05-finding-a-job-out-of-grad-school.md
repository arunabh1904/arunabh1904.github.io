# Finding a Job Out of Grad School

Honestly, landing your first job out of grad school in the U.S. can be challenging, especially if you're trying to find your dream job right away and you’re not from a top university. Even if you've spent your grad school years upskilling, working on relevant projects, and conducting research, it can still be tough. Here are some of the things that worked for me:

**Interviewing** is a slightly different beast than actually doing the job. There is a certain progression to it, and you have to prepare for every level.

- **Resume Preparation**: The first step is your resume. Aim for a simple one-pager. Make sure to highlight key projects tailored to the specific role you’re applying for.

- **Code Screen**: Spend time learning the fundamentals of the primary language required for the role (C++ and Python for robotics). Brush up on data structures and algorithms with a curated list like Blind 75.

- **Onsite Interview**: Multiple rounds, including algorithms, behavioral questions, and domain knowledge. Be able to expand on anything on your resume and dive deep if asked.

- **Apply Broadly**: Quantity often beats quality for fresh grads. Keep a spreadsheet with details of your applications.

- **Start Early**: Begin before your final semester, look for research projects or internships.

- **Get Experience First**: Don’t be overly selective about your first role; initial experience can make it easier to pivot later.

- **Career Fairs**: These can be helpful, but don’t rely on them exclusively.

- **Honesty**: Never lie on your resume.
