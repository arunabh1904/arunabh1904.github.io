# GRAD SCHOOL AT MINES

In 2016, I moved to the United States to pursue a Master’s degree in Robotics at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM). CSM is a relatively small STEM school, but it had a challenging program that required significant effort to succeed. I remember feeling out of place during my first few months. Everything was new and unfamiliar—the culture, the academic environment, and even the way classes were taught. As an introvert, this adjustment period was particularly tough. Over time, however, I found my rhythm and began to genuinely enjoy learning.

Before the start of the semester, I looked for on-campus opportunities to become self-reliant as soon as possible. I was persistent in checking the listing board and eventually landed a teaching assistant position. As a TA, I assisted the professor in grading and administrative tasks. It wasn't the most educational role, but it served its purpose. I was also intentional about my goals for the grad program. I knew I wanted to explore robotics and learn how to code, so I tailored my coursework accordingly. I worked hard in my first semester and took a challenging robotics course with Dr. Andrew Petruska, a new professor who was instrumental in building the robotics program at Mines. By excelling in his course, I secured a research assistant position in his lab.

In my second semester, I joined Dr. Petruska's lab as a research assistant. Initially, I worked on a project involving magnetic manipulation, but I quickly realized it wasn't something I was passionate about, and my lack of progress reflected that. In my free time, I spent countless hours tinkering with the Husky robot in the lab, even writing my own ROS packages to make it move. Dr. Petruska noticed my interest and transitioned me to that project. That change made all the difference. The lab became my second home, and I spent more time there than at my apartment. I focused on learning the basics and building a solid foundation in C++ programming and ROS. Curiosity was key. One funny story I remember is when we short-circuited the entire onboard compute stack and spent a couple of weeks putting it back together from scratch. It was a lot of fun and a great learning experience.

The third semester at CSM was a turning point in my career. I spent a lot of time conducting independent research, programming the Husky robot for autonomous navigation in GPS-denied environments using optimal control strategies. My research collaborators and I spent countless hours covering the whiteboards in the lab with equations, then implementing them in code late into the night. I also took several robotics courses to supplement my research through projects. I got my first taste of machine learning, hand-coding backpropagation from scratch. I still remember the thrill when the loss decreased for the first time—it was exhilarating. I also built a hexapod robot and implemented SLAM using a 1D LiDAR and a basic Pixy camera. All of this gave me a solid understanding of the components needed for an autonomous robot: building a map, localizing based on that map, perceiving the environment in real time, and planning to reach the goal without collisions. Eventually, we deployed the robot inside CSM's Edgar Mine, achieving GPS-denied autonomous navigation using the MPC we developed. It was freezing inside the mine, but it was incredibly rewarding to see the robot navigate without running into things.

Looking back, what worked for me was focusing on building a strong foundation in the skills I was passionate about and actively seeking out opportunities to apply those skills in practical situations. Grad school isn’t just about getting good grades—it’s about the projects you take on, the challenges you solve, and the connections you make. For students in grad school now, my advice is to take on projects that challenge you, use the resources around you (labs, professors, peers), and focus on what really excites you. That’s how you’ll make progress and open doors in the industry.

### Takeaways
- **Focus on building a strong foundation** in the areas that excite you.
- **It's okay to feel out of place** in the beginning. Navigating many changes at once can be overwhelming, but it's part of the process.
- **Be intentional** about what you want to get out of grad school. Tailor your coursework and experiences to align with your interests.
- **Seek out hands-on opportunities**, like TA and RA positions, to apply your learning in practical settings.
